This project investigates open star clusters using astrometric data from the **Gaia mission**. It applies advanced clustering techniques to identify and characterize stellar groupings in the Milky Way.

 Methods:
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for structural detection  
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for probabilistic clustering  
- Comparative analysis across multiple candidate clusters

Goals:
- Extract meaningful stellar substructures  
- Evaluate clustering performance across different regions  
- Support astrophysical interpretation using statistical modeling

 Data Source:
- Gaia DR2/DR3 astrometric catalogs  
- VizieR
